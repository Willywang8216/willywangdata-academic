 I found data science fascinatingly exciting and daunting (>< 😯). From absolute zero to ,learning is not an easy job. Many times, I found myself stuck at problems for days that could be solved if I had a teacher. Through intensive reading and googling, I was able to (partially) solve most of them. There are many nice and kind people sharing their experiences, learning materials and answering questions online. I benefited, benefit and will still benefit from them a lot. Therefore, I decided to share my own journey of learning and hopefully I could help others.

Anyone who stops learning is old, whether at twenty or eighty. Anyone who keeps learning stays young.” – Henry Ford
